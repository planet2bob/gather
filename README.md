# gather
Gather is a WIP social messaging aggregation platform - to send and receive messages from Slack, WeChat, and Skype accounts all at once. No more notifications on five separate apps, no more need to tediously log into multiple messaging services, Gather combines everything into one to improve your online experience.

This project was created by students of an independent study class. Please feel free contact us at jchristianwu@gmail.com.

To Run Locally:

    $ cd gather/server
    $ pip install -r ./requirements.txt
    $ aws configure
    $ python server.py
